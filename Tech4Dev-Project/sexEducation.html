    <section>
      <strong> Sex Education </strong> <br />
      In simple terms, sex education is about understanding our bodies, making
      informed choices about having children, and staying healthy in
      relationships. It's like having a guidebook for our physical and
      reproductive well-being.

          <strong>Testes: </strong>These are the male reproductive organs that
          produce sperm and testosterone. <br />
          <strong>Epididymis: </strong>Sperm produced in the testes mature and
          are stored in the epididymis.
          <br />
          <strong>Vas Deferens: </strong>A duct that carries mature sperm from
          the epididymis to the urethra during ejaculation. <br />
          <strong
            >Seminal Vesicles,Prostate Gland and Bulborethral Glands:
          </strong>
          These glands produce fluids that, along with sperm, make up semen.
          <br />
          <strong> Urethra:</strong> The tube through which both urine and semen
          exit the body, though not simultaneously. <br />
          <strong>Rectum: </strong>It serves as a temporary storage area for
          feces (solid waste) before it is eliminated from the body. <br />
          <strong>Scrotum: </strong>It serves as a temporary storage area for
          feces (solid waste) before it is eliminated from the body.

          <strong>Ovaries: </strong> These are the female reproductive organs
          that produce eggs (ova) and hormones like estrogen and progesterone.
          <br />
          <strong>Fallopian Tubes: </strong>Tubes that transport eggs from the
          ovaries to the uterus. Fertilization typically occurs in the fallopian
          tubes. <br />
          <strong>Uterus (Womb): </strong>The organ where a fertilized egg
          implants and develops into a fetus during pregnancy. <br />
          <strong>Cervix: </strong>The lower part of the uterus that connects to
          the vagina. <br />
          <strong>Vagina: </strong>The muscular tube that connects the uterus to
          the external genitals. It serves as the birth canal during childbirth.
          <br />
          <strong>Labia, Clitoris, and Vulva: </strong>External female genitalia
          that play roles in sexual pleasure and protection of the reproductive
          organs.

          <strong>Menstruation: </strong>The shedding of the uterine lining if
          pregnancy does not occur. <br />
          <strong>Follicular Phase: </strong>The phase when an egg matures in
          the ovary. <br />
          <strong>Ovulation: </strong>The release of a mature egg from the
          ovary. <br />
          <strong>Luteal Phase: </strong>The phase after ovulation where the
          uterine lining prepares for a potential pregnancy.
